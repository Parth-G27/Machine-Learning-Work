## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into different folders, each focusing on a specific category of machine learning models. The main folders include:

- **Regression Models:** Notebooks related to regression algorithms, such as linear regression, polynomial regression, and ridge regression.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Notebooks covering SVM, a powerful algorithm for classification and regression tasks.
- **Decision Trees:** Explore decision tree algorithms and their applications for both classification and regression.
- **Naive Bayes** classifiers are a family of linear "probabilistic classifiers" with strong independence assumptions between the features. 
- **Random Forest:** Learn about ensemble learning and random forest algorithms.
- **XGBoost:** Dive into the popular gradient boosting algorithm, XGBoost, for improved model performance.
- **Many More:** Additional folders containing notebooks for various other machine learning algorithms.
